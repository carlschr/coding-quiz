# Coding Quiz Project

## About the Project:
* We were tasked with creating a multiple-choice coding quiz.
* The questions and scores had to be rendered with vanilla JavaScript without reloading the page or moving to a new page.
* The scores had to be stored using local storage and retrieved to display the high scores.
* The quiz had to have a timer that was decremented by selecting wrong answers.
